                    Legacy is not just about old machines.
                    It is about stories written over time
                    on racetracks, open roads, and in history itself.
                    Every curve, every engine note, every victory
                    defines an era that cannot be repeated.
                    Legacy stands for patience in pursuit of perfection,
                    courage to innovate before the world was ready,
                    and respect earned only through time.
                    These cars were not built to chase numbers,
                    they were built to be remembered.
